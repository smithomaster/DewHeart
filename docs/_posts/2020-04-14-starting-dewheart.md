title: Starting DewHeart
---

Well... it looks like I've attempted a challenge greater than I thought I would
take. I have decided to make DewHeart, a platformer game in 40 stages, where
the player, Juniper Dew, has to collect Red Bull cans in 40 stages in order to
take her resting heart rate from 0bpm at the start, to 40bpm at the end. Once
she reaches 40bpm, she is released from hospital.

Today, after finishing HeartBeast's Godot platformer game tutorial on YouTube, I
set out to start making sprites for the game, because really, I can't have the
game without sprites. Well... it turns out I'm not that good an artist. So I've
started working on making sprites, but this is gonna take a long time to draw
up, because obviously I've been working with a mouse (not the best tool for art)
and I'm not a really experienced artist. Hopefully I'll develop my skills in
pixel art here so its quicker in the future. Just making the first standing
model of Juniper (not yet finished) has taken a substantial amount of time - and
I'll need to make quite a few different variations on this for different
actions, which I'm sure will give me quite a big challenge. I want to try make
her hair flow in the air while she's running, and change depending on her
movement - not for any grand purpose, but I love her hair (hi Juniper ehehe).

All in all, even though I anticipate a great challenge ahead of me on this
journey, it should be great fun and I should have a cool game for my friends
and I at the end of it - but let's just say Juniper will probably be better by
then.
